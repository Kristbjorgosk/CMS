# REST API web application to add a missing dog.

The Technology I used:

- Python
- Flask
- MySqldb
- Sequel Pro
- Bootstrap
- Postman

side note - I did this project kind of backwords, this is a school project about creating a back end with REST API. As I feel it is better to have a visual interface to see the results in action I did a interface for it straight away and then started taking e deeper look into the API endpoints and how they function in Postman.

I started by creating the front end with python and basic html and bootstrap. Then I created a table in MySql database and did the routes for the frontend. To view the data I used Sequel Pro desktop app.
