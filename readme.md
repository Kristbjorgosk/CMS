# REST API web application to report a missing dog.

It is build with:

- Python
- Flask
- MySqldb
- Sequel Pro
- Bootstrap
- Postman
- Heroku

side note - I did this project kind of backwards, this is a school project about creating a backend with REST API. As I feel it is better to have a visual interface to see the results in action I did an interface for it first and then started taking a deeper look into the API endpoints and how they functioned in Postman.

I started by creating the front end with python and basic html and bootstrap. Then I created a table in MySql database and did the routes for the frontend. To view the data I used the Sequel Pro desktop app.

You can see the web app in action by login in:
username: dummy
pw: test

or sign up and log in with your username.

When you are logged in you can add a missing dog or go to the dashboard where you can see only the dog you have added. If you want to try out the API you can do so by clicking on the api key button on the dashboard, there you find your personal api key and docs on how to work with it in Postman.
